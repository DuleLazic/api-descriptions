Swagger files
---------------------------------
Swagger files are machine readable descriptions that conform to Swagger 2.0 schema. Swagger can be written in yaml or json format. We use yaml as it is easier to read and write and than generate json from it as it is understood by wider set of tools.
####API specific

|------|-------------|
| `{api-name}.yaml` | Description of REST API operations and models |
| `{api-name}-events.yaml` | Description of events published by the module |

####Shared
