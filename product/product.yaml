Also, maybe it is better to have this property as enum, not classification, because there are only few possible types influencing behaviour of the card .. debit, credit, prepaid, gift. [Stefan] This classification in Experience is defined as open. It makes sense to be enumeration, but I would not make changes right now, not to violated balance with EXP. Also, as with some others compliance, it remains free to change with next iteration ot implementation.

Is not modeled in this way, and I think, we will not need this separation, because these is only few values.
