ï»¿Device API Possible problems
=================

When request is valid and no standard status code describes situation, device management API will return status code `440` with one of the following problems in the payload. To learn more see general guidance on [error handling](common-getstarted.html#error-handling).

Range of problem codes for this API is `52400 - 52599`.

First 50 codes in a range `52400-52449` are reserved for situations described by standard http status codes.
