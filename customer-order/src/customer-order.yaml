  title: Customer Order API
  description: |
    Customer order API enables you to initiate, track, query and execute “Self-Care” orders.  You can issue orders for opening new accounts, set up the terms and conditions of the existing and new accounts, grant and revoke mandates to self or others, manage communication preferences like notifications, alerts and contacts and manage channels or cards.  All orders are treated like work items and they go through a series of steps until executed.  The time to complete these steps depends on the type of the customer order.
